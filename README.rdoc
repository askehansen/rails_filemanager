= RailsFilemanager

This is a filemanager for ruby on rails.
It works right away with {CKEditor}[http://ckeditor.com/].

See demo at: http://filemanager-demo.herokuapp.com

== Getting Started

1. Add this to your gemfile:

    gem "rails_filemanager"

2. Run the generator:

    rails generate rails_filemanager:install
    rake db:migrate

3. Now mount the filemanager in your routes:

    # config/routes.rb
    
    mount RailsFilemanager::Engine => "/filemanager"

You can now find the filemanager at /filemanager

== Configuration

=== Authorization

Use the method check_authorization to ensure that a user is logged in:

    # config/initializers/rails_filemanager.rb

    def check_authorization
        raise "unauthorized" unless session[:admin]
    end

=== Storage

The filemanager uses paperclip for storing the files.
You can use your own storage options, if you want to use amazon s3 for instance:

    # config/initializers/rails_filemanager.rb

    RailsFilemanager::Engine.config.paperclip_storage_options = {
        storage: :s3,
        bucket: "static.example.com",
        s3_host_alias: "static.example.com",
        url: ":s3_alias_url",
        path: ":attachment/:id/:style/:basename.:extension",
        s3_credentials: {
            access_key_id: "ACCESSKEY",
            secret_access_key: "SECRET"
        }
    }

=== Translation

The default translation is:

    rails_filemanager:
      upload: "Upload files"
      delete: "Delete %{filename}?"

Say, if your app speaks spanish, you could use this example:

    # config/locales/es.yml
    
    rails_filemanager:
      upload: "Upload archivos"
      delete: "Â¿Eliminar %{filename}?"

== Roadmap

* Organize in folders
* Custom javascript callback
* Adding unit tests
